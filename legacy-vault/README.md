# LegacyVault

A classic, elegant, and secure vault‑inspired web application. LegacyVault blends a vintage "Old but Gold" aesthetic with a modern React/Next.js stack to deliver a refined experience for creating and unlocking vaults, visualizing security cues, and showcasing cinematic vault interactions. It is designed as a practical learning project and a compelling demo for secure‑by‑design UI patterns.

## Description

LegacyVault is a modern web application that simulates the flow of creating and unlocking a digital vault with an emphasis on clarity, trust, and presentation. The project focuses on three pillars:

1) Design authenticity — a matte gold, antique steel look and subtle metal textures evoke the feel of a traditional bank vault. Micro‑animations and refined motion choices (gentle fades, slides, and glows) support a sense of weight and craftsmanship without distraction.

2) Usability and clarity — screens and components are purpose‑built to guide users through the vault lifecycle with minimal friction. Typography uses Merriweather for expressive headings and Inter for readable body text. Consistent components (vault cards, gold/steel buttons, structured forms) provide strong visual hierarchy and recognizable interaction patterns.

3) Practical security concepts — the app models vault creation/unlock flows and surfaces security overlays, scan cues, and status indicators. The architecture is modular, making it straightforward to integrate real encryption, secret sharing, or cloud backends as future enhancements. Libraries such as `secrets.js-grempe` and `firebase` are included to enable experimentation with secure recovery and data storage scenarios.

Who benefits? Students and practitioners who want to learn modern frontend patterns while studying how presentation can strengthen trust in security workflows. Teams can adapt LegacyVault into demos, onboarding flows, or proof‑of‑concepts showcasing secure UX.
